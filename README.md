# Hello, nerds

I code for projects that are required for university work or personal projects, believe it or not. I'm known working on projects such as: Soapbox Race World Unofficial Installer, AnimeHeaven Banners, and My WordPress Preloader Plugin. I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example my [SBRW Docs](https://github.com/DavidCarbon-SBRW/SBRW-Documentation-Page) repo.

Currently, I'm a full time Student with spare time to work on side projects. If you would like to discuss these things, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidCarbon_Jr) and shoot a DM. You can also [ask me anything (within reason)](https://github.com/DavidCarbon/ama).
